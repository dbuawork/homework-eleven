In March, when the trees begin to bloom, spring comes.
The last Sunday of March, they celebrate Mother’s Day.
Children prepare cards, poems and songs for their mums.
Another important spring holiday is Easter.
On 1st of May they don’t work, because it’s a Labor Day.
They decorate their houses and the traditional maypole with garlands and ribbons. Then they dance around the maypole.
